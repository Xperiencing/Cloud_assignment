##Container Management System Instructions

A bash file has been created and stored within the VM. The bash file calls the curl 
commands one by one in a logical order (will add containers and images first before
deleting any). The server is being run on localhost on port 8080. This is done
in the manager of the swarm. The swarm has already been created and has two worker
nodes connected, with the docker service running NGINX.

External IP of VM: 35.205.170.234
